This is my code for a duplicate detection method using LSH and classification.
First all the functions are created and at the bottom I run the code using all the created functions. 
The data is first cleaned, then shingling minhasing, signatures and the LSH are inmplemented. After that classifiaction and the performance functions are used.
The code is written in python.
